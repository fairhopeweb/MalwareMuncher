# Malware Muncher

Malware Muncher is a Python proof-of-concept script that utilizes the Frida framework to enable binary instrumentation and API hooking. It is designed to intercept commonly-used API calls by malware, allowing users to analyze their behavior and identify potential threats. Furthermore, the script can leverage GPT to enhance the analysis output, providing more detailed and accurate insights into the malware's activities and identifying potential Mitre ATT&CK techniques. This tool was demonstrated at the [Malware & Reverse Engineering conference in Melbourne](https://speakerdeck.com/fr0gger/binary-instrumentation-for-malware-analysis).

Note: It's important to keep in mind that Malware Muncher is a proof-of-concept tool and may contain bugs or limitations.
